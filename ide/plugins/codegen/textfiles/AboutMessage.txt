The output of the VDM to Java code generator can be imported directly
into Eclipse as an Eclipse project. The generated code is output in the
generated/java project folder.

The Java code generator indicates to the user if a construct cannot be
generated by highlighting it in the editor using a marker and also
outputs messages about it in the console.

Code generation runtime library:

The generated Java code depends on a runtime library to represent
constructs such as VDM collections and VDM types in the generated Java
code. The binaries and sources are available in the %s and
%s files in the %s project folder.
